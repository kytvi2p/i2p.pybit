0.1.5 - 07.02.2009
-----------------------
Blub:
- added function "changeSamBridgeAddress()" which changes the ip address and port of a destination
- added function "changeDestinationName()" which changes the name of a destination (the name which is displayed on the router console)


0.1.4 - 28.01.2009
-----------------------
Blub:
- added functions to get the amount of currently available bytes in the recv buffer of a sam tcp socket
- fixed bug which prevented the removal of internal data structures for some closed sockets
- added shutdown() function, which guarantees that the main-loop thread dies before the function returns, to SamSocketManager and AsyncSocketManager
- SamSocket doesn't try to get its own i2p destination already in the constructor but only if needed


0.1.3 - 25.12.2008
-----------------------
Blub:
- added another implementation of AsyncSocketManager which is based on poll instead of select; the poll-based one is preffered and automatically used if poll is available (poll is available on Unix-like systems but not on Windows)
- fixed bug in AsyncSocketManager which occured if an existing working connection got added (not done by this lib, so this bug didn't happen)


0.1.2 - 21.09.2008
-----------------------
Blub:
- added logging of thread starts and stops
- increased select timeout to one second


0.1.1 - 06.09.2008
-----------------------
Blub:
- AsyncSocketManager now returns a unique id for each socket (instead of the descriptor number of the real socket)
- prepared support for changing the max buffer size of existing AsyncSocketManager sockets (the actual changing is not yet implemented)
- renamed two SamSocketManager functions, more consistent that way:
  getFreeOutBufferSpace -> getSamSocketFreeOutBufferSpace
  getRemoteDestination -> getSamSocketRemoteDestination
- added function "getSamSocketErrorReason" which returns why a certain sam tcp socket failed (or None if the socket didn't fail)
- added recv limit threshold setting: Can be set for each sam tcp socket; SamSocketManager waits until the recv limit increases more than the set threshold before sending a new receive limit to the SAM bridge, should reduce overhead if data is received in very small chunks; defaults to half of the inbound buffer size


0.1.0 - 24.08.2008
-----------------------
Blub:
- added support for setting a default queue size for incomming sam connections
- added support for changing the session options of an existing sam destination
- added wrapper class which emulates the poll interface (SamPoll, SamSocket.py)
- added wrapper class which is similiar to the socket interface (SamSocket, SamSocket.py)
- the accept() function of SamSocketManager now returns a list of tuples of (socketNumber, remoteDestination)
- sockets, which are not valid and in the errorInterest parameter, will be returned in the error set by the SamSocketManager select call


0.0.4 - 17.08.2008
-----------------------
Blub:
- handle failed stream sends; they shouldn't happen because the lib keeps track of sams buffer status, but once in a while they do, probably in border cases (connection fails a short moment before we try to send for example)
- fixed bug: the "peekOnly" flag of the recv function was not considered when deciding if a sam tcp socket remains receivable
- fixed bug: in certain cases messages which were received from the sam bridge were duplicated or ignored


0.0.3 - 16.08.2008
-----------------------
Blub:
- fixed mayor bug in the send code for sam tcp sockets: sometimes the send buffer didn't get emptied and messages were send twice!


0.0.2 - 14.08.2008
-----------------------
Blub:
- if a tcp destination is removed, all existing sam tcp sockets of that destination are failed instead of closed, cleaner that way
- don't close a sam tcp socket if it has something in its outbuffer, instead wait until the outbuffer is empty and then close it (immediate close can be forced)


0.0.1 - 13.08.2008
-----------------------
Blub:
- initial version
