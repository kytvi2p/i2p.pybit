0.0.4 - 15.02.2009
-----------------------
Blub:
- improved one of the basic elements of the GUI (lists) by using a virtual ListCtrl instead of a ListView, which should reduce CPU usage for large torrent/connection lists
- actually disabled the old way of initialising the log system (caused PyBit to write another logfile)!
- added "--profile" commandline switch, enables profiling of PyBit
- added "PyBit.py", handles all the commandline parsing, profiling setup and printing of profiling statistics, starts the GUI from "Gui.py"
- fixed bug in "Bt": Once a torrent was stopped, it was never again fully started
- fixed bug in "Connection": data is now send without doing recursive calls to "_send" (with >~100 small messages queued this could cause RuntimeExceptions because the maximum recursion depth was reached)
- fixed bug in "Requester": endgame mode (the same data may be requested from different peers at the same time) was activated to early: It got activated once requests for all missing pieces existed, not once all pieces were fully requested
- fixed bug in "TrackerRequester": the raw byte count instead of the payload byte count got send to the tracker
- made "ObjectPersister" threaded: should keep the GUI responsive even if queue changes are stored to disk during heavy disk activity (because these changes are now stored async and not by the GUI thread)
- prevent two torrents with the same infohash to run at the same time: there is no point in downloading/seeding the same thing twice and it breaks things
- fixed GUI refresh (Windows only): For some reason Windows requires an extra call compared to Linux to really refresh the GUI (which adds flickering for added fun). Else changes won't appear, until you click on a row of the list. 
- fixed right-click popup menu (Windows only): For some reason Windows requires a different way of setup for the menu, without it an empty menu is displayed
- fixed annoying log message formating error (tried to insert a string where a number was expected: %d vs %s)


0.0.3 - 08.02.2009
-----------------------
Blub:
- fixed unicode handling within the GUI: Because of a stupid mistake any non-ascii char was causing errors!
- fixed a possible torrent encoding/decoding error


0.0.2 - 07.02.2009
-----------------------
Blub:
- failed IO (full disk, no permission to access file, ...) should now be handled and logged
- improved setup of the logging system, which can now handle both file and console logging (and the loglevel is configurable)
- all config options can now be changed without restarting PyBit
- added a few sanity checks
- fixed lots of small bugs, which weren't triggered in 0.0.1 because the relevant code wasn't yet used
- updated PySamLib from v0.1.4 to v0.1.5


0.0.1 - 30.01.2009
-----------------------
Blub:
- initial version
