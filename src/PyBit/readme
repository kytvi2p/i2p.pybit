Installation
-----------------------
You don't need to install PyBit. Simply extract the archive somewhere (which you probably already did when you read this) and you are done.


Requirements
----------------------- 
PyBit needs the following:
- Python >= 2.5 (tested with 2.5 and 2.6; Python 3.0 is incompatible to python 2.x !)
- wxPython >= 2.6 (tested with 2.6.3.2, 2.8.7.1 and 2.8.9.1)
- python-profiler (optional, only needed if you want to run PyBit with the "--profile" switch to generate profiling stats)

PyBit should run on any platform for which both python and wxPython are available. I tested it mostly on Linux and only a bit on Windows, so Windows and other platforms are more likly to have bugs. Please report any which you encounter to "BlubMail@mail.i2p", I will try to fix them.


Starting
-----------------------
To start PyBit, simply execute "PyBit.py". On Linux "python PyBit.py" should do the trick, on Windows a simple double-click on "PyBit.py" is probably enough.
The first startup will take a bit longer because all python sourcecode files will have to be parsed and a few default files (config, state.db) have to be created.


Configuration
-----------------------
All configuration can be done from within PyBit. The config dialog is reachable from the Menu (Config->Configuration).
All changes are instantly active, restarts are not required.


Known Problems
-----------------------
(these are only the most probable for anyone to stumble upon, look into the file "todo" for a more complete list)
- if the config dialog is opened, a few GTK warnings may be printed to the console => the cause is unknown but these warnings shouldn't cause any problems
- the torrent name is displayed twice in the "General"-tab, once in the box "Torrent" and once in the box "Other" => this is not a problem, the torrent name is displayed in the "Other" box as a placeholder for other statistics which will be displayed there in the future.
- the GUI flickers => Should only occur if you use Windows. For some reason I need to do a full GUI refresh before Windows displays any changes to GUI windows. The full refresh causes flickering. I don't know of any fix, not even if it is my fault or wxPythons/Windows. Without the call which invokes a full refresh, the GUI objects do ask me for the current data, but it still is not displayed. Weird behaviour.
- PyBit doesn't seem to get any peer from the tracker => some http responses from the tracker are currently not supported (if many peers exist, the response will use a different encoding), this will be fixed soon. PyBit should still get incomming connections because the announce to the tracker does still work.


Special Files
-----------------------
changelog
- simply the changelog of PyBit, not used internally except for displaying it

config.conf
- contains all user configurable settings
- will be (re-)created with default settings if it doesn't exist
- any missing option and any option with an invalid value will be set to the default when PyBit is started

copying
- license of PyBit, not accessed from PyBit

profilingStats
- only present if PyBit was run with the "--profile" commandline argument
- contains the statistic data which was gathered

readme
- this file

state.db
- a sqlite database, used to store the necessary information to readd all torrents after quiting and restarting PyBit
- if this file is deleted, all torrents will have to be readded manually

todo
- a simple list of things which need fixing and other development related notes, not used by PyBit


Folders
-----------------------
Bittorrent and Bittorrent/PySamLib
- contains additional python source files

Icons
- contains the icons which are used within PyBit

Logs
- contains all logfiles
- once a logfile reaches 10MB, it is moved to "log.x", "x" being a number, and a new one is created
- 5 old logfiles are kept, older ones are deleted
- neither the maximum size (10MB) nor the number of kept logs (5 including the current one) is currently configurable
- the logfile called "log" (the current logfile) should only be deleted after PyBit terminated

Torrents
- contains copies of the torrents which are currently queued in PyBit (this also means that PyBit never accesses the original torrent file after creating the copy btw)
- do not delete these manually, these files will be deleted if you remove the corresponding torrent from PyBits queue
