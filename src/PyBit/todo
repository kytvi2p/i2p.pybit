General
-----------------------
- add callbacks for all relevant classes (choker, samSocketManager, ...) to the instance of the config class (=don't require restarts for config changes!)
- fix CPU-usage bugs (Requester and some places in ConnectionHandler for example)
- fix strange log errors (used "%i" or "%d" instead of "%s" in a log message somewhere? Or is the wrong data getting logged somewhere?)
- setup logging the normal way, don't generate different loggers for instances of the same class
- prevent adding the same torrent twice?
- more exception handling/logging in the GUIs
- webinterface? (with support to only start the webinterface = headless mode?)
- persist gui changes with ObjectPersister (enabled columns, ordering, ...) ? Would need a fail-safe way to reset to defaults in case of screwed up changes.


Classes
-----------------------

Bittorrent.Connection:
- handle failing data handle (outrequests)

Bittorrent.ConnectionBuilder:
- timeout

Bittorrent.ConnectionHandler:
- send "completed" event to tracker, once we completed a torrent (execute callback, probably some function in Bittorrent.Bt)

Bittorrent.ConnectionListener:
- timeout

Bittorrent.ConnectionPool:
- rename to "PeerPool": this class is more about having an overview over existing peers, not that much about connections

Bittorrent.HttpRequester:
- add another timeout for the whole request (trigger after the entire request took a certain time, regardless of transfer activity)
- don't generate a general "invalid header received" error for 404-responses (and other such failures)!

Bittorrent.MultiBt:
- only load a certain number of torrents at the same time (number should be configurable)
- add some kind of scheduling?

Bittorrent.Requester
- handle failed writes of finished requests
- really prefer rare pieces, regardless of current in-progress pieces (RAM vs efficiency tradeoff = optional?)

Bittorrent.Storage
- raise own exceptions on file access errors
- cleanup, add another lock only for loading and use the existing ones for all other (external) funcs
- handle failures inside the load() function

Bittorrent.Tracker Requester:
- prevent us from adding ourselve as a possible peer


Config:
- add override to set() to prevent the options from being saved to disk after getting modified
- add commit() to force saving the options to disk

ConfigDialog:
- prevent the Config class from writing all options to disk after each single set() to speedup things - do one commit() call at the end

SorteableList:
- fix column moving (doesn't work if scrolled to the right)
- virtualise list to reduce CPU usage, try to use Mixins for things like sorting
