Installation
-----------------------
You don't need to install PyBit. Simply extract the archive somewhere (which you probably already did when you read this) and you are done.


Requirements
----------------------- 
PyBit needs the following:
- Python >= 2.5 (only tested with 2.5 but 2.6 should also work. But python 3.0 is incompatible to python 2.x !)
- wxPython >= 2.6 (only tested with 2.6.3.2)

PyBit should run on any platform for which both python and wxPython are available. I tested it on Linux, so other platforms are more likly to have bugs. Please report any which you encounter to "BlubMail@mail.i2p", I will try to fix them.


Starting
-----------------------
To start PyBit, simply execute "Gui.py". On Linux "python Gui.py" should do the trick, on Windows a simple double-click on "Gui.py" is probably enough.


Known Problems
-----------------------
(these are only the most probable for anyone to stumble upon, look into the file "todo" for a more complete list)
- once in a while a traceback of a failed logging will be printed to the console (if you started PyBit from one) => this is completely harmless
- if the config dialog is opened, a few GTK warnings may be printed to the console => the cause is unknown but these warnings shouldn't cause any problems
- the GUI can use quite a few CPU cycles => only select the "Connections"-tab if you really want to look at the connections; selecting the "General"-tab saves you ~80% of the overall CPU usage (without the GUI PyBit never exceeded 2% CPU usage on my system ...)
- there are weird symbols displayed in the "General"-tab, following the description "Info Hash" => this is not a problem, what you see is the binary identifier for that torrent. It is displayed there as a placeholder for other statistics which will be displayed there in the future.
- if I move a column sometimes nothing happens or the wrong one is moved => scroll as far left as possible before moving columns around, else weird stuff will happen
